## Expected behavior

## Actual behavior (from `emacs-helm.sh` if possible, see note at the bottom)

## Steps to reproduce (recipe)

## Backtraces if any (`M-x toggle-debug-on-error`)

## Describe versions of Helm, Emacs, operating system, etc.

## Are you using `emacs-helm.sh` to reproduce this bug (yes/no):

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Helm provides a script named `emacs-helm.sh` which runs Helm in a neutral
environment: no other packages and only minimal settings.

When possible, use it to reproduce your Helm issue to ensure no other package is
interfering.

To run it, simply switch to the directory where Helm is installed and call `./emacs-helm.sh`.

Thanks.
